// Recommended API

//It is recommended to use either the mysqli or PDO_MySQL extensions.
// It is not recommended to use the old mysql extension for new development, as it was deprecated in PHP 5.5.0 and was removed in PHP 7. 
// A detailed feature comparison matrix is provided below. The overall performance of all three extensions is considered to be about the same. 
// Although the performance of the extension contributes only a fraction of the total run time of a PHP web request. Often, the impact is as low as 0.1%.
