I realise that Google Docs can be used as a database system for archiving JSON or XML data.

Furthermore, as far as I known, Google Script can be used to customize JS file for interacting with Google Apps services such as Google Docs or Sheet.

What's next to me? 

Have a go with PHP as usual and JS as well.
